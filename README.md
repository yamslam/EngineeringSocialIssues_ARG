# üé≤ Engineering Social Issues - An Alternate Reality Game and EER SBER study
All game, course, and data collection/analysis content for Rowan's Sophomore Engineering project "The Rubber Project". This project was initially developed by myself (Dr. Cayla Ritz) and a team of faculty members at the university (Dr. Cheryl Bodnar, Dr. Melissa Montalbo-Lomboy) to encourage students to engage meaningfully with a social problem in the context of a design challenge. 

# üìã Project Description 
This project is run as part of Rowan Univeristy's sophomore engineering clinic 1 (SEC1) curriculum. SEC1 is an interdisciplinary engineering core course focused on teaching engineering students fundemental principles of engineering, such as research design, parametric design, engineering design cycle, engineering ethics, techincal writing, and teamwork. Paired with the techincal engineering lab portion, SEC1 focuses heavily on student's communication ability, requiring students to hand in a series of reports and literature reviews to better understand the research and dissemination process. 

There are two modules to this project: 1) materials testing and 2) design-build-test of an autonomous robotic vehicle. In the first module, students complete a series of materials testing on various elastomers and plastics to determine the material properties.  The tested materials included student-made silicone rubber, shore 95A thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), and polylactic acid (PLA). After completing the materials testing, students were asked to determine the yield strength, Young's modulus, and stress/strain behavior of the material. The results of this test help inform students on some of their design choices for the second module. The results of this experimental activity were then reported in a scientific IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion) style report written by student teams (3-4 students).

The second module was the design-build-test part of this project. Students were told they were competing for a contract with a company called "Meals on Mini Wheels". The company was interested in finding a group of talented engineering students to design a autonomous food delivery robot for Rowan's campus; the winning team would get the contract. The product would deliver meals to hungry students on campus wherever they were at any time of day, helping to combat the social issue of food insecurity among the college student population. Student teams were provided with the chassis shell and were tasked with designing 1) all terrain tires that could replace a formal suspension system, and 2) the circuitry and logic for autonomous drop off. To complete the first deliverable, students completed a parametric design cycle for the vehicle‚Äôs tires. Students were encouraged to think about how the treads of the tires could contribute to the vehicles‚Äô overall ride dynamics. Groups could choose to make their tires out of any of the tested materials from the previous module of the project (silicone, TPU, or PLA). The designs were then tested for performance using an accelerometer to measure roll (rotation about x), pitch (rotation about y), and ride (acceleration along z).

Concurrently, student groups were working on the autonomous driving circuit for the vehicle. Student teams were able to ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù up to 3 sensors for their car. Available to them were sonar sensors and infrared (IR) sensors. Sonar sensors detect the distance that another object is from the sensor by sending out a sonic signal and reading the total time that it takes for that signal to be reflected off the object and back to the sensor. IR sensors detect changes in light in a greyscale, meaning that this sensor returns a range of values which translate into colors ranging from pure black to pure white.

# üëæ Alternate Reality Game (ARG) Overview
The core mechanic of the ARG for this project centers around the lived experience of the students while working on their teams to complete the project in this course. The loose structure of the game‚Äôs narrative allows each student to have their own unique experience and provides autonomy surrounding the choices that they are making in the judgments. The project for this course was designed around a social issue which college students may already be familiar with‚Äîfood insecurity on college campuses. The motivation for using a social issue relevant to college students was because I believed it would resonate with their personal experiences and immediate concerns, fostering deeper engagement with the project. This project informs students that they are working for a company called ‚ÄúMeals on Mini Wheels‚Äù, a company looking to design autonomous, contact-free food delivery robots for Rowan‚Äôs campus. 

One important aspect of the project was budget tracking. Students were told that they were working for the fictional company, ‚ÄúMeal on Mini Wheels‚Äù, as a contractor. Ultimately, the company would select the design that had the best cost-to-performance ratio. This competitive component is where the ‚Äúgamified‚Äù aspect of the project comes in. On the final day of class, students competed in a series of obstacle courses to score points based on their design. The first test was a terrain course where teams had to complete the course with their tire design without veering off and without losing their payload. Teams were able to earn up to ten points for completing this course and meeting all the criteria.

The second test was the autonomous driving component of the vehicle‚Äôs design. Student cars needed to follow a black line and land in the center of a target, also known as the ‚Äúdelivery zone‚Äù (Figure 5.5). The vehicles were scored based on how close to the center of the target they were able to park their vehicle. In this course, vehicles needed to be able to travel completely independently, meaning that once the vehicle was placed on the ground, the team members could no longer touch the car. As previously mentioned, students could use sensors to measure different parameters, such as the distance away from obstacles like walls or the color of the floor below the vehicle. These sensors cost money (in-game currency, not real money)  and contributed to the overall cost of the vehicle, impacting their cost-to-performance ratio.

Students competed for the best cost-to-performance ratio by completing the aforementioned set of obstacle courses. Students had two opportunities to try the course and the highest of the two earned scores was taken into consideration for their total score. Students were encouraged to make tweaks between attempts but were not allowed to make major adjustments to the vehicle. The final scores of both obstacle courses were added together and the total cost of the student team‚Äôs vehicle was then divided by this value to obtain the final cost-to-performance ratio. As described later in this section, there were certain events in the game that the students could choose to participate in which could influence student team‚Äôs spending during the ARG.

# üî¨ SBER Research Process and Publications 
To collect data in this study, a series of surveys were distributed to students in the six participating sections of Sophomore Engineering Clinic I. In this study, data was collected through two pre-surveys, six judgments distributed throughout the semester, and one post-survey

The first portion of this study involved administering two surveys on the first day of class through Qualtrics, a web-based survey platform (Pre-surveys 1 & 2). Pre-survey 1 had the students respond to six decontextualized hypothetical situations where they were asked to make a judgment. Each situation had two options for the student to choose between. Once the students chose their response, they were then asked to qualitatively explain their rationale for choosing the selected option. Each of the options were provisionally coded to reflect one of the six criteria from the conceptual framework. This framework, though initially applied to the process safety context, was built on literature from a variety of industries.

Pre-survey 2 asked students to rank six criteria from the conceptual framework in terms of what they believed was most important to them when making judgments in public welfare contexts. The survey also measured students‚Äô perceptions of engineers‚Äô professional responsibility using the Engineering Professional Responsibility Assessment (EPRA) survey instrument. The EPRA ‚Äúmeasures students‚Äô social responsibility attitudes and operationalizes the professional social responsibility development model, which describes the development of personal and professional social responsibility in engineers‚Äù (Canney & Bielefeldt, 2016, p. 1). This survey instrument was intended to be used to assess curricular interventions which are specifically focused on issues of engineering social responsibility. I utilized the Likert scale items presented in the survey as these items have shown that they have validity evidence in the three measured realms (personal social awareness, professional development, professional connectedness) and eight measured dimensions (awareness, ability, connectedness, base skills, professional ability, analyze, professional connectedness, costs-benefits) (Canney & Bielefeldt, 2015, 2016). This survey was administered on the first day of the course and again at the end of the semester (as the ‚ÄúPost-survey‚Äù in Figure 5.1) to determine how these measures changed over the course of the semester.

The second portion of the study involved students making judgments related to the in-class project and served as the basis for the game. Students‚Äô simulated behaviors were collected through an alternate reality game (ARG). The ARG presents contextualized and non-hypothetical versions of the judgments that students saw in Pre-survey 1. The alignment between the judgments presented in the pre-survey and during the ARG helped to link students‚Äô espoused beliefs to their simulated behaviors to understand both quantitatively and qualitatively how their beliefs and behaviors did or did not align. The six judgments, both the hypothetical and non-hypothetical versions, can be found in Appendix B (Table B.1 and Table B.2, respectively). Following the completion of data collection for each survey, the data was exported, and identifying information was replaced with anonymized numerical identifiers to protect participants.
