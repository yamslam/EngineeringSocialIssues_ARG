# Engineering Social Issues - An Alternate Reality Game and SBER Study
Game and data analysis content for Rowan's Sophomore Engineering project "The Rubber Project". This project was initially developed by myself (Dr. Cayla Ritz) and a team of faculty members at the university (Dr. Cheryl Bodnar, Dr. Melissa Montalbo-Lomboy, Dr. Sujata Bhatia) to encourage students to engage meaningfully with a social problem in the context of a design challenge.
