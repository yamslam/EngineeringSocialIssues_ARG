You are included in this study because you will be participating in the automotive rubber project as part of your sophomore clinic coursework. We anticipate the overall number of participants to complete the survey portion of our study to be 100-144 students.<br>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>This survey will take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. Your selection of whether to participate in this study or not has no bearing on your grade for Sophomore Engineering Clinic I. Inclusion of your data within the study is done on a voluntary basis.<br>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this research study is to determine whether engineering students\u2019 beliefs differ from their behavior when engaging with problems related to public welfare and how their perception of an engineers\u2019 professional and social responsibility changes over time.&nbsp;We are also interested in learning more about how the alternate reality game may influence students\u2019 understanding of value creation related to their design projects.&nbsp;Along with your response to this survey, we will be collecting intermittent decisions (through Qualtrics) that you complete throughout the semester, which will be de-identified prior to conducting any data analysis. Some of these decisions you make in the surveys will impact the projects you and your team are working on over the course of the semester. Survey responses and associated intermittent data will only be used in data analysis if you elect to consent to participate in the study by selecting the appropriate button below.<br>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>There are no risks or discomforts associated with this survey. There may be no direct benefit to you, however, by participating in this study you may help us understand how an alternate reality game implemented in Sophomore Engineering Clinic I helps students in developing an understanding for how engineering judgment factors into social issues and public welfare&nbsp;as well as its influence on students\u2019 perception of value creation.<br>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Your responses will be kept confidential. We will store the data in a secure computer file and the file will destroyed once the data has been published. Any portion of the research that is published as part of this study will not include your personal information.

The costs that are covered include travel&nbsp;to a conference to present the results of the study.
