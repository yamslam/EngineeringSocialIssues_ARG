The purpose of this research study is to determine how engineering students\u2019 beliefs differ from their behavior when engaging with problems related to public welfare and how their perception of an engineers\u2019 professional and social responsibility changes over time. You are included in this survey because you will be participating in the automotive rubber project as part of your sophomore clinic coursework. Along with your response to the survey, we will be collecting intermittent decisions (collected through Qualtrics) that you complete throughout the semester, which will be de-identified prior to conducting any data analysis. Some of these decisions will impact the project you and your team are working on. We anticipate the overall number of participants to complete the survey portion of our study to be 100-144 students.\n\nThis survey will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. <br><br>Inclusion of your data within the study is done on a voluntary basis. All survey responses will remain completely confidential. Survey responses and associated intermittent data will only be used in data analysis if you elect to consent to participate in the study by selecting the appropriate button below. Your selection of whether to participate in this study or not has no bearing on your grade for Sophomore Engineering Clinic I.\n\nThere may be no direct benefit to you, however, by participating in this study you may help us understand how an alternate reality game implemented in Sophomore Engineering Clinic I helps students in developing an understanding for how engineering judgment factors into social issues and public welfare.\n\nYour response will be kept confidential. We will store the data in a secure computer file and the file will destroyed once the data has been published. Any portion of the research that is published as part of this study will not include your personal information. If you have any questions about the survey or the study in general, you can contact Dr. Bodnar (lead researcher in the study) at bodnar@rowan.edu.","DataExportTag":"Introduction","QuestionID":"QID1317362323"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_cT6rlza3uuAc9gy","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID1317362324","SecondaryAttribute":"Please enter your full name","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"Please enter your full name","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"TE","Selector":"SL","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Please enter your full name","Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":4,"NextAnswerId":1,"SearchSource":{"AllowFreeResponse":"false"},"QuestionText_Unsafe":"Please enter your full name","DataExportTag":"Name","QuestionID":"QID1317362324","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false}}},{"SurveyID":"SV_cT6rlza3uuAc9gy","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID1317362325","SecondaryAttribute":"To participate in this survey, you must be 18 years or older.
