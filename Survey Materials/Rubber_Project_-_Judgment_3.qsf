The focus for these materials has been the functionality and sustainability benefits of the product, specifically emphasizing that we will be reducing carbon emissions by replacing some full-size delivery vehicles on campus. While this is true, our prototype may have other environmental impacts that we were not considering. An individual on our marketing staff worries that the tire manufacturing process (3D printing with TPU) and the single-cell, non-reusable batteries in our prototypes contradict our company's values regarding sustainability. These concerns also conflict with the emphasis we have placed on sustainability in our promotional materials thus far. I understand that we are too far along to make large changes to the prototype's overall design and manufacturing process, but we need some guidance on how to respond to these concerns on the marketing side.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nHow would you like to address this issue? We can choose to move forward with current promotional materials because the emission claims are true.
