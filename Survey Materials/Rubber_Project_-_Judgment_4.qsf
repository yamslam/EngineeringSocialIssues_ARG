I am reaching out to you today with a request that requires careful consideration and your expert opinion. We are currently facing a production dilemma where we are evaluating the necessity of a proximity alarm on our product to alert nearby pedestrians of the robotic food delivery vehicle.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nThe proximity alarm has been a standard component of previous similar product designs, ensuring compliance with industry regulations and providing an added layer of protection for our customers. However, due to an oversight on the company's part, this was not included as a requirement in your production deliverables. This situation has prompted us to reassess the feasibility of the safety feature without compromising the overall quality and functionality of the product.<br>\n<br>\nI recognize that safety is a paramount concern for our customers and our organization. Therefore, I urge you to thoroughly evaluate the impact and potential consequences of choosing to not include the alarm system. We need your expertise to determine if there are alternative measures or design modifications that can maintain an acceptable level of safety while reducing the production complexities and associated costs.<br>\n<br>\nI understand that this request may put you in a challenging position. I trust in your professional judgment and integrity to thoroughly evaluate the situation and provide a well-informed recommendation that upholds both our production goals and our commitment to customer safety.<br>\n<br>\nThank you for your attention to this important matter.<br>\n<br>\nBest regards,<br>\n<br>\nAnita&nbsp;<br>\n<em>Meals on Mini Wheels&nbsp;<br>\nProjects Coordinator<\/em>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Question","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Dear ${q:\/\/QID2\/ChoiceTextEntryValue}, I hope this email finds you well.

The choice to implement the alarm system to the product makes a lot of sense, and I believe it will reassure our customers to know we have decided to implement the safety feature into our prototype. I know that with your level of expertise that you will be able to integrate this deliverable into your timetable without too much difficulty.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nYou will be able to purchase a buzzer and any additional sensors that you will need from the distributor. The proximity alarm system will need a way to detect objects near the vehicle to prevent collisions. If you haven't implemented one already, you may also need to purchase a sonar sensor for this.
