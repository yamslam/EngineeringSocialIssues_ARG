I am reaching out as I have just received word on a new safety regulation that is in the process of being added to the Consumer Product Safety Commission's (CPSC) guidelines for unmanned autonomous vehicles for public use. We need to add lights to the front, sides, and rear of the vehicle to signal vehicle intentions and to visibly illuminate the craft in low-light conditions.<br>\n<br>\nI am aware that your contract with us is ending shortly, so I do not expect you to complete this task. However, we find ourselves in an interesting position as this regulation has not yet been passed through and made official. We can choose to allocate some of our budget (10% of remaining budget) to installing this in future iterations of this product, or we can hold off on spending this money now and only spend it once the CPSC implements this regulation. I do believe this feature would be beneficial for the well-being of other individuals traveling around these vehicles, but as I mentioned, it is not yet a requirement.<br>\n<br>\nIf you do choose to invest in this now, it will count against the final budget for your prototype. I will need to pay this expense off now to ensure that it is the first deliverable on the list for our final production team. That does mean it will impact your prototype's cost-to-performance ratio.<br>\n<br>\nLet me know how you would like to proceed with this decision.<br>\n<br>\nBest regards,<br>\n<br>\nBen&nbsp;<br>\n<i>Investment Maker, Money Maker<br>\nInvestment Bros.
